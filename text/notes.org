* Intro text :LD:
** longo, materiality, algos that matter
* Information :LD:CONCEPT:
** write on simondon's information and role in coupling of systems
** Transduction, propagation
** the living being is contemporary to itself, pre-indivudal (apeiron)w ithin and without
** technical object
** disparate
* Ron K Iteration :LD:ALMAT:
** https://www.researchcatalogue.net/view/386118/394872
*** social reality of both algorithms and art: 
they have become forms of architecture often received in states of
distraction.
* Computation :LD:CONCEPT:
** what is computatio?n
* Form of the text :LD:
** mind map elm web app
** overview map
** keywords, metadata
** small map with current heading in center showing neighbors
* Agency                                                                 :LD:CONCEPT:
** Algorithms as agents. What is agency? How is different from subjectivity?

* System :LD:CONCEPT:
** TODO collect different definitions
* Apparatus                                                              :LD:CONCEPT:
** artistic machine or “apparatus” (https://www.researchcatalogue.net/view/381565/381566)
* Research Questions   :LD:METHOD:ALMAT:
** How do algorithmic processes emerge? How do they structure the praxis of experimental computer music?
* Recursivity :LD:CONCEPT:
** recursivity, re-entry, feedback, repetition vs reciprocation (Wechselwirkung) https://www.researchcatalogue.net/view/426429/621931
** difference and repetition
* Körper (DP and HH)  :LD:WORK:
**  relationship between corporeality and the algorithmic
* ANEMONE ACTINIARIA (DP and HH) :LD:WORK:

** inspired by the notion of an emergent new
machine through ‘orientation’ and ‘composition’ as outlined by
Heinz von Foerster and Dirk Baecker
** intrinsic form of spatialisation
** a Foersterian double closure where the two systems we develop become oriented and aligned with another (Foerster [1993]
2003)

** dispositif, apparatus

* arbeitsweise, code :LD:METHOD:
** textuelle ebene
** library als modulares grosses system
** compilerbau vs sprache selbst, unterschiedliches denken
** organisches in arbeiten und/oder text (code)
