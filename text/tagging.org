* general metadata fields for entire page
** title: 
** type: meta - refers to page
** persons: e.g. [JR, HHR, DP, POZ]
** kind: e.g. Introduction
** keywords: e.g. [live coding, speech recognition]

* inheritance
** normally fields accumulate (from page to objects on page)
** default is overwrite, append/inherit first element of array is "_"
* inferred
** type for media: image, video, audio, text etc 
** links-to with links in texts
** navigational elements with text only containing a link, connects pages but not an object
* page is also an object

* issues
** photo: keywords
only the content or also the context?
** kind and type is getting ambigous
I think it make sense to use kind to distinguish different media
type is also a specification when we have a 'textual' kind
